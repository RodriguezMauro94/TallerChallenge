Create an Android app that simulates a login process using Kotlin coroutines. The app should have the following features:

Login form: Design a simple login form with fields for username and password.
Simulated authentication: Utilize Kotlin coroutines to simulate an authentication process. For example, you can use a coroutine with a delay to mimic the authentication process taking some time.
Display login result: After the simulated authentication, display a message indicating wh
ether the login was successful or not.
Error handling: Handle cases where the login process encounters errors or invalid credentials gracefully, displaying appropriate error messages to the user.

Bonus (optional):

Loading indicator: Show a loading indicator while the authentication process is ongoing.
Remember me: Add an option to remember the user's login credentials for future sessions.
